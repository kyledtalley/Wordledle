Use [`expo-router`](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## üöÄ How to use

```sh
#Download Expo Go app from App Store or Google Play if you're a green texter
npx create-expo-app -e with-router #Don't know if you have to do this since I already did it
npx expo start #This will start up expo Go, then scan the QR code with your Expo GO App
#If this says "There was a problem loading the requested app then do npm i -g expo-cli, and then expo-cli start --tunnel //MIGHT BE DEPRECATED IF IT'S DEPRECATED GOOD LUCK
#npm i should include stuff like react-native@0.74.2 axios react-native-dotenv
#make sure you cd into wordleHints (spelled correctly) from GitHub/worldeHints (spelled incorrectly- toooootally on purpose). worldeHints/wordleHints. It doesn't want me to rename the file it's in sorry

```
